The objective of this study is to construct the appropriate forecasting model forthe Export Volume of Thai Rubber. The forecasting models used in this study are decomposition method, Exponential smoothing method,andBox-Jenkins method. the Export  Volume  of  Thai Rubberis  secondary  data  gathered Rubber  Intelligence  Unitduring  January  2011to  December  2022(144values),  is  divided  into  two  sets.  The training data set has 132values, which are the data from January 2011to December 2021, and it is used for constructing the forecasting model. The test data set had 12values, which are the data from  January 2022toDecember  2022, and it is used for checking the accuracy of the forecasting models. The criterion of model evaluation is the  lowest  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE)  and  using  Minitab  18,  Python,and  Excel Office 365 as the data analysis program.Research results indicate that thedecomposition methodhasgiven the lowest RMSE.
